This project demonstrates two different approaches to pattern recognition in Java:

Regular Expressions using Pattern and Matcher

Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) using transition tables


Contains topics like:

Regular expressions,
Finite automata,
Compiler construction fundamentals


This project demonstrates two different approaches to pattern recognition in Java:

Regular Expressions using Pattern and Matcher,
Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) using transition tables


The code is designed for learning purposes, particularly in topics such as:
Regular expressions,
Finite automata,
Compiler construction fundamentals


The ouput looks like:
Input String :"hello",
number = false,
id = false,
string = true,
comment = false
